## Dungeoneer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ReeceLangerock/dungeoneer.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ReeceLangerock/dungeoneer)


### App Built Using

- React
- Redux
- Create-React-App
- Styled-Components
- Jest / Enzyme Tests
- Travis.CI

### App Objective
Build a React app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/PNJRyd/.

### App Built To Meet these Requirements

- User Story: When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.

- User Story: I have health, a level, and a weapon. I can pick up a better weapon. I can pick up health items.

- User Story: All the items and enemies on the map are arranged at random.

- User Story: I can move throughout a map, discovering items.

- User Story: I can move anywhere within the map's boundaries, but I can't move through an enemy until I've beaten it.

- User Story: Much of the map is hidden. When I take a step, all spaces that are within a certain number of spaces from me are revealed.


- User Story: When I beat an enemy, the enemy goes away and I get XP, which eventually increases my level.

- User Story: When I fight an enemy, we take turns damaging each other until one of us loses. I do damage based off of my level and my weapon. The enemy does damage based off of its level. Damage is somewhat random within a range.

- User Story: When I find and beat the boss, I win.

- User Story: The game should be challenging, but theoretically winnable.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
